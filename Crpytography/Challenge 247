Challenge: You're drunk!


Description:
You're presented with a message that looks like gibberish:
Ayowe awxewr nwaalfw die tiy rgw fklf ua xgixiklrw! Tiy lew qwkxinw.

The challenge title is "You're drunk!", and we have asked to submit the flag based on that.

If you don't know what kind of, you can check here  (https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier)

Analysis:
From the initial observation, the message seems oddly close to readable English but with several incorrect characters. To confirm the cipher we used https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier and determined that it likely involved a keyboard shift.

Solution:
We decoded the message using the tool:
https://www.dcode.fr/keyboard-shift-cipher to decode the key board string:
Input: Ayowe awxewr nwaalfw die tiy rgw fklf ua xgixiklrw! Tiy lew qwkxinw.

After decoding we got some text with some text and specail character like this
	Super secret mess;ge for you the gl;g is chocol;te@ You ;re welcome/

The semicolon ; appears to be a mistyped a, due to keyboard proximity.
The @ is likely meant to be a period or just part of the sentence.
After fixing obvious typos:

Super secret message for you the flag is chocolate. You are welcome.


We got the flag that is 
FLAG: chocolate
