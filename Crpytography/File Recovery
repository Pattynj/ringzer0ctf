After downloading the provided ZIP file, we extracted its contents.
Inside, we found:
flag.enc — the encrypted flag file.
private.pem — an RSA private key in PEM format.

These file types are commonly used in networking, when using asymmetric encryption to communicate with another party, with .enc containing the ciphertext and .pem the key to decrypt it.

We can use the openssl
In the command terminal type
"openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -in flag.enc -out flag.txt -inkey private.pem "

Check the flag.txt and we got our flag
