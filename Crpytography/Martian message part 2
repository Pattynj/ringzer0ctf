Challenge Description

Martian message part 2
I think that's the key "fselkladfklklakl"

KDERE2UNX1W1H96GYQNUSQT1KPGB

The ciphertext contains uppercase letters and digits, suggesting the alphabet is not standard A–Z.
We also have a possible key string consisting of lowercase letters.
Given this structure, possible ciphers include:

Vigenère with an extended alphabet (A–Z + 0–9)

Autokey cipher

Other polyalphabetic substitutions

with the help https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher tool 
I tested the given key "fselkladfklklakl" in a Vigenère cipher decoder with an extended alphabet:
and the ciphertext "KDERE2UNX1W1H96GYQNUSQT1KPGB".

Using a custom alphabet Vigenère decoder, the output was:
FLAGU2JNU1R1X96VOFNKHLB1GEWQ
